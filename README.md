# Spotify Playlist Optimisation Project

## Introduction
As music providers have enabled music to become more personalised and widely available, listening to songs has become a part of my daily routine. I often create playlists for different moods and genres, from hip hop to lo-fi to acoustic. However each time I create a playlist, it takes time for me to order the songs so that there are smooth transitions between each track. Another aspect of music I enjoy is rediscovering old songs as it brings back nostalgia.
Using Spotify’s API, I decided to develop an algorithm to sort tracks in order to optimise the flow of songs in a playlist. I also pulled through and sorted my top twenty songs in any given period from my Spotify data, so I could ‘rewind time’ and bring back old memories.
